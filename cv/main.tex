\section{Research interests}

I currently work in the arithmetic of abelian varieties over global fields, specifically on the special values of their twisted L-functions in the context of the refined Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. I am involved in the formalisation of arithmetic geometry in interactive theorem provers, being a pioneer in the development of the theory of elliptic curves in Lean. I am also interested in understanding local-global obstructions to rational points on varieties, via cohomological gadgets such as the Brauer group. Finally, I am passionate in pedagogical aspects of undergraduate mathematics education.
